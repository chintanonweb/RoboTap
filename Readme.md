I've created a polished implementation of Click-A-Bot with the following features:

Game Mechanics:

Robots appear randomly on the screen
Players have 2 seconds to click each robot
Score tracking and high score persistence using localStorage
Lives system (3 lives)
UI Elements:

Clean, modern design with a dark theme
Smooth animations and transitions
Responsive HUD showing lives, current score, and high score
Start screen and game over screen
Visual feedback on robot interactions
Technical Features:

Built with React and TypeScript
Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
Optimized performance with React hooks
Lucide React icons for visual elements
The game is now ready to play! Click the Start Game button to begin, and try to click as many robots as you can before they disappear. The game saves your high score locally, so you can try to beat your personal best.
